## When everything you thought you knew about systems programming (C/C++) is literally no more...
Prof Maxwell Fowler, or to anyone else who stumbles here, may it be an assistant or otherwise:

When I embarked on the journey that was the Christoffen Assets App last summer, I explicitly avoided learning to work with pointers. Yes, that was in pure C. Why did I leave out probably the most important part of C from my self-taught curriculum? Because pointers are akin to fire, and one wrong move, say goodbye to your home. 

At the time, I had no idea what Rust was. But now I'm learning Rust for similar reasons that I avoided pointers. It's kind of like an eye for an eye: You can either learn ownership in Rust or pointers in C. I chose the former, obviously. Rust won't let you compile a program if it detects things won't go well for you in the future. Essentially, cargo saves you from yourself. Regardless of the CompSci course I take at IPFW starting this upcoming August, I will hold these values close. 

So yes, professor reading this right now, I'm terrible at math. Don't tell the math department at Elida High School that, because I had notoriety: Teachers I didn't have would come compare their answer sheets to mine if they needed any sense of peer review. I was known to be adamant on doing things on my own. Tutors would absolutely have the most difficult time with me simply because I wasn't willing to let them do the work for me (yes, as backwards as it sounds, that's the case. I know, it sounds hardly believable, but it was the case). 

That being said, future professor(s), prepare yourselves for some difficult questions from yours truly. You don't realize just how little you actually know until you try teaching something to someone else. And talk to Mark Suter at EHS, because I shot him down on multiple questions. Nothing wrong with him; he was trying to teach a class that I'm not necessarily sure he was well prepped for to begin with. I will (probably) do the same to you as I did to him if the opportunity arises. 

Also, before going into this project's details below, I will point out that I don't own a single Windows box. So if you run some Debian bullshit in a VM, I'm going to laugh because I probably have something ~6 months ahead of you on actual hardware through Fedora already. I'm equipped and rarring to go, it's the system in place that's holding me back - IPFW has a disproportionate math dependency. On a final note, when playing with HTML/CSS in the first round, I will likely be writing anything you tell me to write in HTML/CSS in PugJS (formerly Jade) and SASS. From there, you can take either the generated XML (I can write it, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out why one would take the alt path) aka the HTML output, or you can take the Pug/SASS. However, regardless of how you want the end result, the journey is more important than the end or the start, and I will be making use of the tools I've learned work best over my self-taught journey. Pug/SASS are DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself, aka don't make me repeat myself). I read the first course description, and I've learned HTML/CSS to the most reasonable extent and can help teach others if need be (this is EXTREMELY BASIC, and I hope I'm not the only one who knows this stuff besides yourself). 

So, future professor, if you find yourself here, this is a memo coming from M. Gage Morgan. It is a checkpoint in my history for anyone rolling through here. 

## Dragons Be Ahead
This repo (hopefully) will begin to take shape through the course of this summer. Due to the level of mindf\*\*\*\ that is Rust, I will be starting work on a simpler project that could help build the bigger Christoffen project ConCurr Algebra. However, due to my level of experience (or lack thereof) with ownership/borrowing/referencing (all different things in Rust), I have set out to do something simpler. That's all there is to it. I didn't jump ship, just put plans I told some folks about on hold. 

With that disclosure out of the way, the early code as of this writing is rough, and potentially inefficient. Right now, it is a scratch box full of tiny Rust "scripts" that attempt to see what ways of doing things works best. 

More updates will come here around mid-July (maybe?)
